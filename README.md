#About App
  The app can be used in both mobile and web views.

  Facebook Comment Generator is a app that utilizes Facebookâ€™s graph API. The app uses a Markov chain algorithm to generate a random post you might say, based on post you have made through Facebook.

  My personal goal for this app is to improve my object oriented programming skills, build a backend that accepts information from an API and sorts the data into a useable sentence that can be passed into the client view as a random post someone might say.
