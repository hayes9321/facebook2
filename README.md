#About App
  The app can be used in both mobile and web views.

  Facebook Comment Generator is an app that utilizes Facebookâ€™s graph API. The app uses a Markov chain algorithm to generate a random post you might say, based on post data obtained through Facebook's Graph API.

  My personal goal for this app is to improve my object oriented programming skills, build a backend that accepts information from an API and sort incoming data with the help of a Markov chain.
